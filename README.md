# Centrale d'Alarme Microcontroller Project

This repository contains the implementation of a central alarm system using a PIC 16F877 microcontroller. The project is developed with MicroC for PIC and simulated using ISIS PROFESSIONAL.

## Files in the Repository

- `programme.c`: The source code for the microcontroller, written in C.
- `programme.hex`: The compiled binary file to be uploaded to the microcontroller.
- `Séance N°5.DSN`: The simulation file for ISIS PROFESSIONAL.
- `Project_Subject.pdf`: The PDF document describing the project.

## Prerequisites

To use and run this project, you will need:

- MicroC for PIC 
- ISIS PROFESSIONAL (Proteus)
- A PIC microcontroller development board

## How to Use the Files

1. **MicroC for PIC**:
   - Open `programme.c` in MicroC for PIC.
   - Compile the code to ensure there are no errors and to generate a `.hex` file if needed.

2. **Uploading the HEX File**:
   - Use a PIC programmer to upload the `programme.hex` file to your microcontroller.

3. **Simulating with ISIS PROFESSIONAL**:
   - Open `Séance N°5.DSN` in ISIS PROFESSIONAL.
   - Simulate the circuit to test the functionality of the alarm system.

## Running the Project

1. Ensure that your development environment is set up with MicroC for PIC and ISIS PROFESSIONAL.
2. Compile the source code (`programme.c`) if modifications are made.
3. Upload the compiled `programme.hex` to the PIC microcontroller using a suitable programmer.
4. Open the simulation file (`Séance N°5.DSN`) in ISIS PROFESSIONAL to visualize and test the system.

## Project Overview

This central alarm system project is designed to enhance security by monitoring and responding to specific triggers. The system is built around a PIC microcontroller, leveraging its capabilities to control and manage alarm functionalities.
